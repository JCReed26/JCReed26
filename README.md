# Hi, I'm Jimmy Reed
### AI Engineer | GTM Engineering | Backend & Cloud Systems | Python Developer | Building Scalable Agentic Architectures | FSU CS Graduate

My work bridges the gap between **Scalable Cloud Systems** and **Business Strategy**. Leveraging technical expertise in **Python & Backend Engineering** alongside an academic focus in Business Analytics, I architect robust **Agentic AI** solutions to **plan, design, and execute** products that solve real market problems.

---

### 🚀 What I'm Building

* **Agentic AI Architectures:** Developing hierarchical multi-agent systems using the **Google ADK** and **LangChain** ecosystems. My focus is on agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex workflows across disparate APIs.
* **ZStyle Services (Autonomous Executive Assistant):** An intelligent productivity ecosystem designed to augment human executive function. It connects lifecycle data (Calendar, Email, Tasks) to an AI Executive assistant, allowing users to focus on critical thinking while agents handle repetitive online administrative workflows.
* **Infrastructure as Code:** Automating secure, scalable cloud deployments on **GCP** using Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Agentic AI:** Google ADK, LangChain, LangGraph, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Agent-2-Agent (A2A), Model Context Protocol (MCP)
* **Backend & Logic:** Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
* **Cloud & DevOps:** Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run, Cloud Armor), Terraform, Docker, CI/CD
* **Strategy:** Solutions Architecture, Technical Feasibility, GTM (Go-To-Market) Strategy
